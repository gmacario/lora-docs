From http://www.udoo.org/forum/threads/how-to-program-the-m4-without-the-arduino-abstraction.4210

>> As the title say, How to program the m4 without the arduino abstraction?

> One way is to use [FreeRTOS](http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers-and-processors/arm-processors/i.mx-applications-processors/i.mx-6-processors/i.mx6qp/i.mx-6-series-software-and-development-tool-resources:IMX6_SW); Download the zip and look for the documentation.

>> What is the .fw format?

> Binary currently is the current method; need to use udooneo-m4uploader copy binary into memory and start the M4.
